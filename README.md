# SNPore
Forensic Nanopore SNP sequencing

## Synopsis

The capability of Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ (ONT) handheld sequencer MinION™ to created a forensic SNP profile was tested. 
In order to bypass the minimum fragment length requirement of 100 bp, set by the Metrichor base-calling software, the PCR amplicons have to be pooled and ligated randomly to create longer fragments.
This repository contains the code to split the concatenated reads into to subreads and the subsequent SNP detection. 

## Motivation
